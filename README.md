I am Samarth S Alva, Student of Yenepoya University, persuing my BCA Hons in Software Product Engeenering.
I have build this small Hand cricket game that is computer vs user, where there are certain criteria under which you need to win the game.
Talking more about Hand-Cricket game:-

Hand cricket is a simple yet engaging game that pits a user against the computer in a simulated cricket match using hand gestures as representations of runs. Players take turns being the batsman and the bowler.

The player and the computer both pick a number from 1 to 6, attempting to outsmart each other by guessing the opponent's choice. If the numbers match, the batsman is out. If they don't match, the number represents the runs scored by the batsman.

The game continues for a fixed number of overs or until the batsman is out. The winner is determined by the total runs scored, with the player aiming to outscore the computer within the set number of overs without being dismissed.

Thank You so much.
